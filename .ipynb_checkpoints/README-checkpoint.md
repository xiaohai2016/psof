### An Optimal Data Fusion Algorithm  in the Presence of Unknown Cross-covariances

* The simulation codes comparing PSOF vs KF with naive independence assumption are in [dist_fusion_psof.ipynb](dist_fusion_psof.ipynb) (Figure 1).
* The simulation codes for convergence simulations (figure 2 and 3) are in [psof.ipynb](psof.ipynb).
